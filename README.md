### Welcome to my Page!

## Introduction
- A geoscientist with professional experience in energy and environmental policy research, and traineeship experiences in GIS and Earth observation data analytics, groundwater prospecting, water quality control, and sustainability reporting.

## About Me
Lukman Fashina is a doctoral student in the Department of Geography and Sustainability (GIScience and remote Sensing) where his research interests focus on GIS, remote sensing, environmental change monitoring, and hydrologic modeling. His previous research explored the water quality of karst springs as a private water supply source in northeast Tennessee, and GIS-based DRASTIC modeling of intrinsic groundwater vulnerability to contamination in Pennsylvania.
Lukman earned his BSc in geology from University of Ibadan, Nigeria and an MSc in petroleum geoscience from Pan African University, Nigeria and M.S. degrees in sustainable water management from Tufts University and geosciences (Major: geospatial analysis) from East Tennessee State University
He has worked as a Research Associate at a public policy think-tank in Lagos, Nigeria where he specialized in energy and environmental policy research and performed research design and evaluation on sustainable development issues within Nigeria. His work experience in hydrogeological and environmental fields have enhanced his understanding of the complexity of water resources management. Among his numerous honors and awards, Lukman is an American Water Resources Association's (AWRA) Rising Star 2021-2022 and an awardee of the Richard A. Herbert Memorial Graduate Masters Division Scholarship. When he is not studying, he enjoys volunteering and has previously volunteered in numerous educational and community development services.
